# Android Alternate Traits
Anomaly	KEY:Android ~ Anomaly	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Android Race Trait.SpecialQuality.Constructed.Emotionless	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Android ~ Anomaly],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Emotionless]	DESC:Sometimes, a particularly volatile soul can overwhelm the technology of an android body, making the resulting individual subject to emotions, and greatly so. Anomalous androids suffer a -2 racial penalty on saving throws against all mind-affecting effects, emotion effects, and fear effects but can gain the benefits of morale bonuses and suffer no penalty on Sense Motive checks. Additionally, Bluff and Sense Motive are always class skills for them. This racial trait modifies constructed and replaces logical.

Androids with this trait treat their Charisma score as 2 points higher for the purpose of the channel energy and lay on hands class features, and also for oracle class features (including both spellcasting and revelations). Furthermore, conduits treat their caster level as 1 higher when casting cure and inflict spells. This racial trait replaces nanite surge.

Such androids suffer a -4 penalty on Bluff checks. This racial trait replaces logical.	BONUS:SKILL|Bluff|-4	COST:0	SOURCEPAGE:p.9

Ironspy	KEY:Android ~ Ironspy	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Android Race Trait.SpecialQuality.NaniteSurge	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Android ~ Ironspy],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.NaniteSurge]	DESC:Android bodies built for stealth and infiltration employ camouflage circuitry, foregoing the capacity for a nanite surge, since the resulting display can compromise delicate missions. Androids with this trait reduce the penalty for using Stealth while moving at full speed by 5 and reduce the Stealth check penalty for sniping by 10. This racial trait replaces nanite surge.

Androids with this trait choose a bloodrager or sorcerer bloodline at 1st level and treat their Charisma score as 2 points higher for all bloodrager and sorcerer class abilities (including spellcasting) if they have that bloodline. Androids with both bloodrager and sorcerer class levels gains this benefit for both bloodlines if they have the same bloodline for each class. Additionally, magitech androids gain a +2 racial bonus on Spellcraft checks. This racial trait replaces nanite surge.

These lizardfolk have a climb speed of 15 feet, allowing them to take 10 on most Climb checks and granting them a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks (see the Climb skill description in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook for more details). Additionally, a Climb check that fails by 9 or less means that she makes no progress, and one that fails by 10 or more means that she falls from whatever height she has already attained. The lizardfolk must not be wearing a hands or feet slot item in order to benefit from this ability. This replaces the lizardfolk’s swim speed and hold breath racial trait.

As a full-round action, the lizardfolk gains concealment from creatures more than 10 feet away (attacks have a 20% miss chance), and total concealment from creatures more than 40 feet away (attacks have a 50% miss chance), but is considered flat-footed (regardless of any ability that would otherwise prevent it, such as uncanny dodge). The effect ends immediately if she takes any action other than remaining still. This replaces the lizardfolk’s swim speed and hold breath racial trait. A lizardfolk oracle who selects this alternate racial trait may not select the albinism curse (detailed below).	COST:0	SOURCEPAGE:p.6

Diseased Bite	KEY:Lizardfolk (Advanced) ~ Diseased Bite	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RacialTraits.SpecialQuality.LizardfolkAdvancedRacialTrait.LizardfolkAdvancedNaturalAttacks	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Lizardfolk (Advanced) ~ Diseased Bite],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.LizardfolkAdvancedNaturalAttacks]	DESC: Lizardfolk descendants of monitor lizards have gingivitic gums that bleed during feeding, leaving virulent saliva in the bite wounds they inflict.

She gains resistance to one of the following energy types equal to her Hit Dice (maximum 5; this type cannot be changed once chosen): acid, cold, electricity, fire. Once per day, she can also breathe a 30-foot line or 15-foot cone of the energy type chosen as a standard action. This breath weapon deals 1d4 points of damage per Hit Die of the lizardfolk (maximum 5d4, Reflex half, DC 10 + 1/2 the lizardfolk’s HD + the lizardfolk’s Con modifier). If she later gains a breath weapon from another class feature, such as the draconic sorcerer bloodline or the dragon disciple’s breath weapon ability, that breath weapon replaces this one. This trait replaces the lizardfolk’s swim speed, hold breath racial trait, and natural armor bonus; dragonsired lizardfolk may still select the hulk or pygmy alternate racial traits, but at an additional cost (see those trait descriptions for more details).

A lizardfolk hulk receives a +1 size modifier to her Combat Maneuver Bonus and Combat Maneuver Defense. A lizardfolk hulk is also considered to be one size larger when determining whether a creature’s combat maneuvers or special attacks based on size (such as bull rush, drag, overrun, reposition, trip, grab or swallow whole) can affect her. A lizardfolk hulk can use weapons designed for a creature one size larger without penalty. However, her space and reach remain those of a Medium creature. The benefits of this racial trait stack with the effects of powers, abilities, and spells that change the subject’s size category. This replaces the lizardfolk’s natural armor bonus.

A lizardfolk pygmy receives a +1 size modifier to her Armor Class and attack rolls, and a +4 size bonus on Stealth checks. A lizardfolk pygmy can use weapons designed for a creature one size smaller without penalty. However, her space and reach remain those of a Medium creature.
