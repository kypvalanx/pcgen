Android (Advanced)	OUTPUTNAME:Android	SORTKEY:a_base_pc	STARTFEATS:1	SIZE:M	MOVE:Walk,30	FACE:5	REACH:5	LANGBONUS:ALL	BONUS:STAT|DEX,INT|2	BONUS:STAT|CHA|-2	ABILITY:Internal|AUTOMATIC|Race Traits ~ Android (Advanced)	RACETYPE:Humanoid	RACESUBTYPE:Android	TYPE:Humanoid.Base.PC	SOURCEPAGE:p.4	FACT:IsPC|true	AUTO:LANG|Common	DESC:Superficially, androids resemble humans, sharing their general physical shape and other characteristics, such that in crowded urban communities, androids pass for locals with ease. Two things set these strange beings apart from humans, however, and both hint at their technological origins. An android’s eyes shimmer with a kind of metallic glow, and strange subdermal biocircuitry snakes across his skin, in patterns that resemble ritualistic or otherwise symbolic tattoos. Android bodies are entirely synthetic, made from strange materials and crafted to resemble human bones, muscles, and organs with surprising accuracy. Their bodies even contain systems of artificial nerves and veins, through which flow electrical impulses and a metallic oil not unlike blood, respectively. Androids come in the same range of shapes and sizes as humans do, with the average android being about 6 feet tall and weighing perhaps 200 pounds.

#Catfolk (Advanced)	OUTPUTNAME:Catfolk	SORTKEY:a_base_pc	STARTFEATS:1	SIZE:M	MOVE:Walk,30	FACE:5	REACH:5	LANGBONUS:Elven,Gnoll,Gnome,Goblin,Halfling,Orc,Sylvan	BONUS:STAT|DEX,CHA|2	BONUS:STAT|WIS|-2	ABILITY:Internal|AUTOMATIC|Race Traits ~ Catfolk (Advanced)	RACETYPE:Humanoid	RACESUBTYPE:Catfolk	TYPE:Humanoid.Base.PC	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	FACT:IsPC|true	AUTO:LANG|Common|Catfolk	DESC: All catfolk stand between 5 and 6 feet tall and have retractable claws and a tail. Two distinct types of catfolk are prevalent among the race’s many populations, however. One evolutionary branch, the Saebul, is comprised of cat-headed humanoids, with distinct feline bone structure, eyes, movable external ears, and thick fur. All manner of markings and colorations found in cats are present in this subspecies. They tend to be tall, hardy, and muscular. The other branch, known as the Faol, more closely resembles humans, with smaller, more lithe builds and less fur, but retains obvious ties to their feline ancestors. Their skin color varies as much as that of humans, although with pronounced pigmentation markings reminiscent of vitigilo but mimicking the stripes and spots of cat species.

#Changeling (Advanced)	OUTPUTNAME:Changeling	SORTKEY:a_base_pc	STARTFEATS:1	PREGENDER:F	SIZE:M	MOVE:Walk,30	FACE:5	REACH:5	LANGBONUS:ALL	BONUS:STAT|WIS,CHA|2	BONUS:STAT|CON|-2	ABILITY:Internal|AUTOMATIC|Race Traits ~ Changeling (Advanced)	ABILITY:Internal|AUTOMATIC|Race Traits ~ Hag Mother (Advanced)	RACETYPE:Humanoid	RACESUBTYPE:Changeling	TYPE:Humanoid.Base.PC	SOURCEPAGE:p.4	FACT:IsPC|true	AUTO:LANG|Common	DESC:Hags are not immortal. They are not particularly nurturing. They have no males among them. These three factors conspire toward their extinction—held off only by the existence of changelings. Changelings, the offspring of hags and males of other races, are always female. The fate of a changeling’s father—life or death, sanity or madness— rests on the whims of the hag and her coven. Left on the doorsteps of prospective foster parents, changelings are most often raised by strangers. On those occasions where the father survives the hag’s courtship, he is “gifted” with the changeling. Typically tall, slender, dark haired, and attractive, changelings’ heterochromatic eyes and abnormally pale skin hint at their true heritage. Changelings otherwise resemble the races of their fathers.

#Elans (Advanced)	OUTPUTNAME:Elans	SORTKEY:a_base_pc	STARTFEATS:1	SIZE:M	MOVE:Walk,30	FACE:5	REACH:5	LANGBONUS:ALL	ABILITY:Internal|AUTOMATIC|Race Traits ~ Elans (Advanced)	RACETYPE:Humanoid	RACESUBTYPE:Aberrant	TYPE:Humanoid.Base.PC	SOURCEPAGE:p.4	FACT:IsPC|true	AUTO:LANG|Common	DESC:Elans are created rather than born. Those chosen by the secretive elan councils come from a variety of races, all of whom shed their prior form to become psionically awakened, superior life forms. Drawing sustenance from their own inherent psionic energy, they do not age or require sleep. (Elan spend four hours a night in a trance state which is the equivalent of eight hours of sleep for most humanoids). They are incapable of breeding, instead “uplifting” other sentient beings to create more of their race. Among the psionic races they are sometimes referred to as the Created, which can be used as praise or an insult depending on the source. Little is known of the ritual used to create new elans. It is a jealously guarded secret known only to the inner circle of a few of the oldest councils. These groups, called triads, are composed of three of the eldest elans. Each one has two thirds of the ritual, known only to that individual and his apprentice. These six elans are guarded by elite psychic warriors and creche defenders. No matter what the base humanoid stock was, an elan’s final form resembles that of a human in height and weight. Unlike humans, they seem to brim with energy, with sparkling eyes, shining skin, and hair that at times seems to almost have a life of its own. Elans can often pass for humans if not observed too closely or if they keep their features shrouded.

Lizardfolk (Advanced)	OUTPUTNAME:Lizardfolk	SORTKEY:a_base_pc	STARTFEATS:1	SIZE:M	MOVE:Walk,30	FACE:5	REACH:5	LANGBONUS:Aquan,Dwarven,Grippli,Sylvan	BONUS:STAT|STR,CON|2	ABILITY:Internal|AUTOMATIC|Race Traits ~ Lizardfolk (Advanced)	RACETYPE:Humanoid	RACESUBTYPE:Reptilian	TYPE:Humanoid.Base.PC	SOURCEPAGE:p.92	FACT:IsPC|true	AUTO:LANG|Common|Draconic	DESC:Most lizardfolk resemble iguana descended humanoids, with thick scales and spines running down the length of their backs and tails. Scale coloration varies from a bright blue to all shades of yellow and green and several hues of dusky brown. Lizardfolk who evolved from other species of lizards also exist; depending on the individual racial traits they possess, a tribe may more closely resemble geckos, chameleons, or monitors, with scale coloration varying correspondingly. Some lizardfolk  95 are also descended in part from true dragons, and typically sport the scale coloration and bone structure of the type of dragon whose genes they inherited. Although their average height and weight are only slightly more than that of humans (6 to 7 feet tall, 200 to 250 pounds), lizardfolk hulks and pygmies represent extreme outliers to the median, with varying statistics.

#Merfolk (Advanced)	OUTPUTNAME:Merfolk	SORTKEY:a_base_pc	STARTFEATS:1	SIZE:M	MOVE:Walk,5	FACE:5	REACH:5	LANGBONUS:ALL	BONUS:STAT|DEX,CON,CHA|2	RACETYPE:Humanoid	RACESUBTYPE:Aquatic	TYPE:Humanoid.Base.PC	SOURCEPAGE:p.4	FACT:IsPC|true	AUTO:LANG|Common|Aquan	DESC:Merfolk have a human torso, strong, muscular, and toned. Their lower half is either a sturdy singular tail with fins or eight appendages lined with suckers and smooth skin. The lower torso of these merfolk come in a variety of grays, browns, pinks, red and occasionally jet black. A finned merfolk on the other hand often has a tail of scales that vary in hues. Some merfolk have the natural ability to camouflage with their environment while others show off their tail with flashy bright colors and patterns. A few finned merfolk have smooth skin on their tails and they are always black or gray in color. Some deep ocean-dwelling merfolk have more perverse characteristics such as overgrown teeth and blackened eyes. Some rare merfolk still harbor fins along their backbone and appendages like antennas on their head. These merfolk are rare indeed; they are bigger in the chest and stronger, but due to their appearance are loners. Generally, however, merfolk live in colonies and societies with one another.
